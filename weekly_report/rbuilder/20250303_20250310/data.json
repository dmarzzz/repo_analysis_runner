It shows how you can catch the InvalidTransaction::LackOfFundForMaxFee error and parse it to grab the necessary information to attempt a bundle sponsorship.\r\n\r\n**I started this PR months ago but didn't carry it out because at the time reth had a bug and was returning the wrong information. I am no longer actively working on it as my priorities have changed, so I'd encourage someone else to pick it up from here.**\r\n\r\nThe next steps for this work:\r\n* Simulate sponsored bundles\r\n* Evaluate if they are profitable to sponsor and handle the results of simulation\r\n* Alter `SimulatedOrder` to include info about sponsorship if desirable\r\n* Parse and handle sponsored bundles when filling orders (e.g. by inserting a sponsor tx with the right nonce)\r\n\r\nBut I haven't thought it out thoroughly!\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udca1 Motivation and Context\r\nSee #25, we might want this because it allows us to execute some transactions and make fees from them that we otherwise wouldn't be able to - thus leading to more valuable blocks.\r\n<!--- (Optional) Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? Remove this section if not applicable. -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## \u2705 I have completed the following steps:\r\n\r\n* [ ] Run `make lint`\r\n* [ ] Run `make test`\r\n* [ ] Added tests (if applicable)\r\n",

It builds off of #55 and #54, which need to be merged first.\r\n\r\nIt does this by adding a csv that contains synthetic bundles, and then loading that with a balance override in the EVM to spoof balances of tx senders.\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udca1 Motivation and Context\r\n\r\nThe idea is to provide a useful set of MEV aware synthetic bundles that can allow for open source contributors to work on bundle merging without access to sensitive data.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## \u2705 I have completed the following steps:\r\n\r\n* [\u2705] Run `make lint`\r\n* [\u2705] Run `make test`\r\n* [ ] Added tests (if applicable)\r\n",

This caused the rbuilder to miss some slots due to its inability to reopen the database during slot execution.\r\n\r\nThe nonce cache has been refactored to use database transactions instead of database handles. This change simplifies the code and reduces the need for database consistency checks.\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udcdd Summary\r\n\r\n<!--- A general summary of your changes -->\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udca1 Motivation and Context\r\n\r\n<!--- (Optional) Why is this change required?

Since we use reth's `eip6110::parse_deposits_from_receipts` implementation in `rbuilder::building` we need to update as well to prevent us from building incorrect blocks on Sepolia.\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udca1 Motivation and Context\r\n\r\nhttps://blog.ethereum.org/2025/03/05/sepolia-pectra-incident\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## \u2705 I have completed the following steps:\r\n\r\n* [ ] Run `make lint`\r\n* [ ] Run `make test`\r\n* [ ] Added tests (if applicable)\r\n",

This fixes the issue above and makes us more robust since before we relied on reth giving us specific error type to cancel slot when reth updated last block and now we check it explicitly.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## \u2705 I have completed the following steps:\r\n\r\n* [ ] Run `make lint`\r\n* [ ] Run `make test`\r\n* [ ] Added tests (if applicable)\r\n",

Since ETH Addresses are already derived by hashing, we don't have to rehash them, but this seemed like overkill :) \r\n\r\n\r\n### parking_lot instead of sync::Mutex\r\nThe `rbuilder` codebase generally uses `parking_lot` Mutex. AFAIK it should have better perf than `sync` one, and also it doesn't have poisoning (so no `unwrap()` is necessary)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## \u2705 I have completed the following steps:\r\n\r\n* [x] Run `make lint`\r\n* [x] Run `make test`\r\n* [ ] Added tests (if applicable)\r\n",

            "body": "The builder gets the fee recipient and suggested gas limit from the MEV-boost relay.\nThere are situations when this data can differ across different MEV-boost relays. To break ties between relays, we use relay priority (which is configurable) and select the slot registration with the highest priority (see relay_epoch_cache.rs).\nHere's how this can play out and why the current tie-breaking policy can be problematic:\n\n1. An MEV-boost user selects a set of relays and submits relay registrations to them, setting parameters to some value P0.\n2. Later, they remove some relays from the list and change parameters to P1.\n3. The relay that was removed from the set will still have the old parameters P0.\n4. If this relay has higher priority, we will use stale parameters P0 to submit to all relays, but the relays actually used by the user will use P1.\n5. When we submit to all relays, our blocks will either be rejected by the current relays that the user uses, or the user will get a block with parameters they no longer want to use.\n\nTo break this tie correctly in this situation, we need to use the most recent user registration (there is a timestamp attached to each registration).\nIt's also a good idea to verify the signatures of these registrations since they contain signatures.",
