            "body": "## \ud83d\udcdd Summary\r\n\r\n1. Use a block store that keeps track of the single best block at all times and streams it to any subscriber: https://github.com/SkandaBhat/rbuilder/blob/82f3d829ad4e9787847c66cb9cc157d22bad57dc/crates/rbuilder/src/building/builders/best_block_store.rs. Also added tests for both the store and tracker.\r\n\r\n2. added a helper function on `Block` that helps keep the comparing logic more readable: [https://github.com/flashbots/rbuilder/compare/develop...SkandaBhat:best-block-store?expand=1#diff-3349e9f2b5d24a3da06ac[\u2026]1334cc81518f9090a131c9dR47](https://github.com/flashbots/rbuilder/compare/develop...SkandaBhat:best-block-store?expand=1#diff-3349e9f2b5d24a3da06aca1fa26fcbf05350fa9091334cc81518f9090a131c9dR47). This is used in best_block_store\r\n\r\n3. In relay_submit, we now subscribe to best_block_store and process best blocks as and when they arrive. BlockBuildingSink and BlockBuildingSinkFactory is not needed anymore here and we now call RelayCoordinator: [https://github.com/flashbots/rbuilder/compare/develop...SkandaBhat:best-block-store?expand=1#diff-1ab827716722c4d9c2be8[\u2026]19983e2a53a4c54b2553bf3cf0](https://github.com/flashbots/rbuilder/compare/develop...SkandaBhat:best-block-store?expand=1#diff-1ab827716722c4d9c2be8a84b5e88be13b839a19983e2a53a4c54b2553bf3cf0)\r\n\r\n4. In bid maker, we call try_and_update on the tracker, which checks if the block is better than the global best block, and if so, updates it on the global best block store: [https://github.com/flashbots/rbuilder/compare/develop...SkandaBhat:best-block-store?expand=1#diff-be9eab4716937ef12a623[\u2026]dfb88b7571d7f82e54c23eR131](https://github.com/flashbots/rbuilder/compare/develop...SkandaBhat:best-block-store?expand=1#diff-be9eab4716937ef12a623774b1bd484f091a5fe1a9dfb88b7571d7f82e54c23eR131)\r\n\r\n5. UnfinishedBlockBuildingSink and UnfinishedBlockBuildingSinkFactory  can be decoupled from BlockSealingBidder  and the Sink can be entirely removed in favour of the new architecture, making the end to end process simpler.\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udca1 Motivation and Context\r\n\r\nWe have a push-based architecture for block building right now, where each builder runs a building algorithm and pushes blocks to a Sink, which sorts the blocks and submits the best block in a loop. This causes unnecessary flooding of the sink with low value blocks and additional overhead for the sink to sort every block it receives.\r\n\r\nWe can instead have a global best block store that stores a single best block at all times, and stream updates to any subscriber. This way, the relay sink can react immediately to updates from the store, and the builders can push best blocks only when they have a block that has a higher bid value than the global best block, thereby keeping the channel only for new best blocks found.\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\n1. Builders report strictly best blocks to a Global Best Block Store\r\n2. The sink subscribes to the Global Best Block Store\r\n3. The sink processes updates(new blocks) to the Global Best Block Store on-demand\r\n4. Builders subscribe to the Global Best Block Store and stores new best blocks whenever they arrive\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## \u2705 I have completed the following steps:\r\n\r\n* [x] Run `make lint`\r\n* [x] Run `make test`\r\n* [x] Added tests (if applicable)\r\n",

It shows how you can catch the InvalidTransaction::LackOfFundForMaxFee error and parse it to grab the necessary information to attempt a bundle sponsorship.\r\n\r\n**I started this PR months ago but didn't carry it out because at the time reth had a bug and was returning the wrong information. I am no longer actively working on it as my priorities have changed, so I'd encourage someone else to pick it up from here.**\r\n\r\nThe next steps for this work:\r\n* Simulate sponsored bundles\r\n* Evaluate if they are profitable to sponsor and handle the results of simulation\r\n* Alter `SimulatedOrder` to include info about sponsorship if desirable\r\n* Parse and handle sponsored bundles when filling orders (e.g. by inserting a sponsor tx with the right nonce)\r\n\r\nBut I haven't thought it out thoroughly!\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udca1 Motivation and Context\r\nSee #25, we might want this because it allows us to execute some transactions and make fees from them that we otherwise wouldn't be able to - thus leading to more valuable blocks.\r\n<!--- (Optional) Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? Remove this section if not applicable. -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## \u2705 I have completed the following steps:\r\n\r\n* [ ] Run `make lint`\r\n* [ ] Run `make test`\r\n* [ ] Added tests (if applicable)\r\n",

It builds off of #55 and #54, which need to be merged first.\r\n\r\nIt does this by adding a csv that contains synthetic bundles, and then loading that with a balance override in the EVM to spoof balances of tx senders.\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udca1 Motivation and Context\r\n\r\nThe idea is to provide a useful set of MEV aware synthetic bundles that can allow for open source contributors to work on bundle merging without access to sensitive data.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## \u2705 I have completed the following steps:\r\n\r\n* [\u2705] Run `make lint`\r\n* [\u2705] Run `make test`\r\n* [ ] Added tests (if applicable)\r\n",

This improves robustness in the tests as production relays are not even mentioned in the test builder configs.\r\n\r\n\r\n## \u2705 I have completed the following steps:\r\n\r\n* [x] Run `make lint`\r\n* [x] Run `make test`\r\n* [x] Added tests (if applicable)\r\n",

Using the same scaffolding of the monitoring task I added support to track the node updates from a canonical stream from the provider (which is the same primitive used by the exex). Then, I use a spawned task to run the new monitoring with the stream once the node has been initialized.\r\n\r\nThis is a patch until ExEx is fixed or we outsource the monitoring to an external entity.\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udca1 Motivation and Context\r\n\r\n<!--- (Optional) Why is this change required?

This led to a `NameError: name 'msg' is not defined`.\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udca1 Motivation and Context\r\nThis fix resolves the error caused by the variable name inconsistency, ensuring that the code runs without any issues.\r\n\r\n## \u2705 I have completed the following steps:\r\n\r\n* [x] Run `make lint`\r\n* [x] Run `make test`\r\n* [ ] Added tests (if applicable)",
